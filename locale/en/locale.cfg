FluidicPower=Fluidic Power

[fluidic-text]
fluidic-mixed-voltage-alert=A connection between incompatible voltages has been detected! This might cause unwanted behaviour and should be fixed.
fluidic-cant-connect-to-romal-fluids=Can't connect Fluidic Power with normal fluids.
non-accessable=[font=default-bold][color=#ff0000]This entity should not be accessable. Use the Fluidic Power version instead![/color][/font]

power-rating=[font=default-semibold][color=#ffe6c0]Power Rating: [/color][/font] __1__
pole-in-variant=__1__ Source
pole-out-variant=__1__
pole-in-variant-description=Use this pole only next to generators, like turbines or solar panels. Cannot connect to another source power pole.
pole-out-variant-description=Supplies power to machines.
pole-transmit-variant-description=Can only be used for power transfer, especially over large distances. It cannot supply power to machines or source power from generators or solar panels.

accumulator=Store energy in a accumulator. Acts like a normal storage tank and requires circuitry for efficient use.

transformer-recipe-name=Transform __1__ to __2__
transformer-recipe-up=Improve electric energy transmission by increasing the voltage. 
transformer-recipe-down=Decrease the voltage of electricity again for functionality at the cost of degraded transmission performance.

what-is-this-label=What is this? [img=info]
what-is-this-tooltip=For [color=cyan]Fluidic Power[/color] to function it essentially changes your base from having one big electric network to every pole having a seperate electric network. This means it would not be possible to observe your [font=default-bold]total[/font] power production and consumption in the conventional way.\n\nThis additional interface shows your the base's actual total power production and consumption, which would otherwise be hard to calculate.\n\n[font=default-bold][color=#ffe6c0]Note:[/color][/font] It's normal for consumption to be less than production at low averaging time scales. It an artefact of the fluid-like electricity slowly flowing through your electric network. However, [color=orange]beware[/color] of when your production is less than your consumption!

fluidic-transformer=Transformer
fluidic-energy-sensor=Energy Sensor

[entity-name]
fluidic-transformer=Transformer
fluidic-energy-sensor=Energy Sensor

[item-description]
fluidic-transformer=Increase/Decrease voltage for more efficient power distribution. Power rating depends on recipe.
power-switch=Used to stop the flow of power when neccesary. It's on by default, and works like a pump.
fluidic-energy-sensor=Measure the amount of power in the pole it's connected to.

[mod-setting-name]
fluidic-electric-overlay-depth=Electric Network Overlay Depth
fluidic-enable-build-limitations=Enable Build Limitations
fluidic-disable-accumulator-alt-info=Disable Accumulator Alt-Info
fluidic-override-pole-wire-length=Increase Maximum Wire Distance

[mod-setting-description]
fluidic-electric-overlay-depth=The overlay shows connections between powerpoles since there's no visible wires. You can choose how far it should draw.
fluidic-enable-build-limitations=This will attempt to prevent you from accidentally connecting your power network to some fluid network. Disable for some fun power through pipes and pumps.
fluidic-disable-accumulator-alt-info=Accumulators show their contents with a icon - similar to storage tanks. This can be disabled with this setting.
fluidic-override-pole-wire-length=Currently Fluidic Power only supports orthogonal pole connections, and not diagonal connections. Enabling this setting will slightly increase (override) all wire lengths to compensate for this limitation.
