---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 11. 03. 2021
  Changes:
    - Improved fluidbox connections for increased power flow. Perfect alignment now necessary.
    - Reduced fluid units to 10kJ, 1MJ, and 100MJ to reduce internal pole buffer.
    - Much nicer icons. (Still WIP though).
    - Rearanged recipe/fluid categories.
  Bugfixes:
    - Accumulators now actually store 5MJ.
    - Overlay now draws all connections.
    - Fixed likely multiplayer bugs.

    - Removed side inputs of transformers.
    - Accumulators now only accepts low voltages (10kJ fluid units) as it should have.
    - Power switch power transfer limit now 50MW of 50GW depending on voltage.
    - Halved internal energy buffer of big poles.
  Bugfixes:
    - Power units now actually available as signals for circuit network.
    - Upgrade planner now works on small poles. (Upgrade filters still wonky)
    - Fixed transformer output distance being too long.
