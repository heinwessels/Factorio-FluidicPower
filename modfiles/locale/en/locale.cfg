fluidic-big-electric-pole=Can only be used for power transfer, especially over large distances. It cannot supply power to machines or source power from generators or solar panels.

fluidic-transformer=Used to increase the voltage of your power. This allows the same power distribution using less fluid.
fluidic-power-switch=Used to stop the flow of power when neccesary. It's on by default, and works like a pump.
fluidic-energy-sensor=Measured the amount of power in the pole it's connected to.
fluidic-accumulator=Power storage of 5MJ, like a large battery. Acts like a normal storage tank, and requires circuitry for efficient use.

[mod-setting-description]
fluidic-electric-overlay-depth=The overlay shows connections between powerpoles since there's no visible wires. You can choose how far it should draw.
fluidic-enable-build-limitations=This will attempt to prevent you from accidentally connecting your power network to some fluid network. Disable for some fun power through pipes and pumps.
fluidic-disable-accumulator-alt-info=Accumulators show their contents with a icon - similar to storage tanks. This can be disabled with this setting.
